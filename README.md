Streaming Relay Google Cloud Server

This project sets up a Google Compute VM instance to serve as an rtmp relay server to effectively multiply the number of streaming output relays for content creators at a reduced cost.

This is important for content-creators because most of the best available options, such as streamyard and OBS Studio, respectively, are either expensive or user-unfriendly.

In the future, we wish to add better features, such as multi-user agents for recordings, and fine-tuning the compute engine for a cost-effective system.
